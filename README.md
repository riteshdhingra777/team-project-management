# How to setup

## Clone the repo

Fork and clone the repo

## Install dependencies

You will need to install the dependencies for both the frontend and the backend.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies

## Create a .env file

Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URL=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING

```

Replace the values with your MongoDB Atlas connection string and a secure random string for JWT authentication.

# Features
